CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'): com/veracode/verademo/controller/ToolsController.java:53
Details: <span>This call to java.lang.Runtime.exec() contains a command injection flaw.  The argument to the function is constructed using untrusted input.  If an attacker is allowed to specify all or part of the command, it may be possible to execute commands on the server with the privileges of the executing process.  The level of exposure depends on the effectiveness of input validation routines, if any. The first argument to exec() contains tainted data from the variables (new String\[...\]). The tainted data originated from an earlier call to AnnotationVirtualController.vc_annotation_entry.</span> <span>Validate all untrusted input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.  When using blocklists, be sure that the sanitizing routine performs a sufficient number of iterations to remove all instances of disallowed characters.

CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting'): com/veracode/verademo/utils/Utils.java:55
Details: <span>This call to javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse.addCookie() contains an HTTP response splitting flaw.  Writing untrusted input into an HTTP header allows an attacker to manipulate the HTTP response rendered by the browser, to inject additional headers or an entire response body into the response stream. Injecting headers can be used to trick various security mechanisms in browsers into allowing XSS style attacks. Injecting entire response bodies can not only cause XSS attacks to succeed but may even poison the cache of any intermediary proxies between the clients and the application server. The first argument to addCookie() contains tainted data from the variables (new Cookie(...)). The tainted data originated from earlier calls to java.util.Base64$Encoder.encode, AnnotationVirtualController.vc_annotation_entry, and java.sql.Statement.executeQuery.</span> <span>Escape, encode, or remove carriage return and line feed characters from untrusted data before inclusion in HTTP response headers.  Whenever possible, use a security library such as ESAPI that provides safe versions of addHeader(), etc. that will automatically remove unexpected carriage returns and line feeds and can be configured to use HTML entity encoding for non-alphanumeric data.  Alternatively, some of the XSS escaping functions from the OWASP Java Encoder project will also sanitize CRLF sequences.  Only create a custom blocklist when absolutely necessary.

Details: <span>The serialized-object data stream used in the call to java.io.ObjectInput.readObject() appears to have been constructed with untrusted data. Attacker manipulation of this stream has the ability to cause the creation of objects of arbitrary Serializable types.

CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting'): com/veracode/verademo/controller/UserController.java:680
Details: <span>This call to javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse.setHeader() contains an HTTP response splitting flaw.  Writing untrusted input into an HTTP header allows an attacker to manipulate the HTTP response rendered by the browser, to inject additional headers or an entire response body into the response stream. Injecting headers can be used to trick various security mechanisms in browsers into allowing XSS style attacks. Injecting entire response bodies can not only cause XSS attacks to succeed but may even poison the cache of any intermediary proxies between the clients and the application server. </span> <span>Escape, encode, or remove carriage return and line feed characters from untrusted data before inclusion in HTTP response headers.  Whenever possible, use a security library such as ESAPI that provides safe versions of addHeader(), etc. that will automatically remove unexpected carriage returns and line feeds and can be configured to use HTML entity encoding for non-alphanumeric data.  Alternatively, some of the XSS escaping functions from the OWASP Java Encoder project will also sanitize CRLF sequences.  Only create a custom blocklist when absolutely necessary.  Always validate untrusted input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.</span> <span>References: <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html">CWE</a> <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/HTTP_Response_Splitting">OWASP</a> <a href="https://help.veracode.com/reader/4EKhlLSMHm5jC8P8j3XccQ/IiF_rOE79ANbwnZwreSPGA">Supported Cleansers</a></span>

Details: <span>This call to org.apache.log4j.Category.info() could result in a log forging attack.

Details: <span>This call to getMoreFeed() contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw.  The application populates the HTTP response with untrusted input, allowing an attacker to embed malicious content, such as Javascript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser.  XSS vulnerabilities are commonly exploited to steal or manipulate cookies, modify presentation of content, and compromise confidential information, with new attack vectors being discovered on a regular basis.

The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc.  Both the OWASP Java Encoder library and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods. For more details on contextual escaping, see https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md.
